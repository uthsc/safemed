        <p>In 2012 the University of Tennessee Health received a CMS Innovation grant under the medication management
            umbrella. The money was used in partnership with Methodist LeBonheur Healthcare to implement an innovative
            approach to care transitions using a team-based approach utilizing nurses, pharmacists, LPNâ€™s and pharmacy
            technicians as community outreach workers, and a social worker. The lessons we learned over the three-year
            implementation period culminate into the SafeMed model described here. This site contains descriptive
            information about the model, success stories, tools for implementation and collaboration, and a sharing of
            our lessons learned through the availability of published papers and presentations. </p>

                <p>My career has been dedicated to primary care and health systems improvement. I am experienced as physician,
                    and patient advocate. I have served as the principal-investigator for several large studies of health system
                    and health care delivery innovations including Project SafeMed, a CMS Health Care Innovation Award, the
                    Robert Wood Johnson Foundation-funded Memphis Aligning Forces for Quality initiative, and an American Heart
                    Association Established Investigator Award. My research has focused particularly on patients with multiple
                    chronic conditions. I have been deeply engaged in partnership with the people and providers of the
                    Whitehaven, Tennessee community for over three years now to find ways to improve care for diabetes and other
                    chronic conditions. My experience initiating and leading collaborative initiatives is extensive and includes
                    serving as the founding chair of the Board of Directors of Common Table Health Alliance, among the first
                    regional health improvement collaboratives in the country. I have a broad background in health systems
                    research, care for chronic illnesses including diabetes, and clinical medicine. I have been a leader of
                    numerous health systems research and healthcare quality reporting initiatives in the MidSouth.</p>
