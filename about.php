        <p>In 2012 the University of Tennessee Health received a CMS Innovation grant under the medication management
            umbrella. The money was used in partnership with Methodist LeBonheur Healthcare to implement an innovative
            approach to care transitions using a team-based approach utilizing nurses, pharmacists, LPN’s and pharmacy
            technicians as community outreach workers, and a social worker. The lessons we learned over the three-year
            implementation period culminate into the SafeMed model described here. This site contains descriptive
            information about the model, success stories, tools for implementation and collaboration, and a sharing of
            our lessons learned through the availability of published papers and presentations. </p>

                <p>Dr. Bailey is a professor of medicine and preventive medicine at the University of Tennessee Health
                    Science Center in Memphis, where he directs the <a href="http://www.uthsc.edu/CHSI/">Center for
                        Health System Improvement</a>, cares for the sick, and teaches doctors in training. Dr.
                    Bailey served as the founding board chair for the Common Table Health Alliance, the MidSouth's
                    regional health improvement collaborative, and spearheaded its signature Robert Wood Johnson
                    Foundation-funded Aligning Forces for Quality (AF4Q) Initiative. Dr. Bailey’s research centers on
                    health system organization and its impact on quality of care and health outcomes for people with
                    chronic diseases. He work particularly focuses on patients with multiple chronic conditions, and he
                    is deeply engaged in partnership with the people and providers of medically underserved areas in
                    West Tennessee to find patient-centered approaches to improve care for diabetes and other chronic
                    conditions. His research appears in many peer-reviewed medical journals, including JAMA, Journal of
                    General Internal Medicine, and Annals of Internal Medicine and has resulted in over 50
                    publications.</p>

                <p>Bailey also has an abiding passion for the classics, medical history, and ethics, and believes that
                    sharing stories is essential to building patient-centered care systems. His first novel,
                    <a href="http://www.endofhealing.com/">The End of Healing</a>, tells the story of a tenacious young
                    doctor who charts a
                    dangerous course to expose the truth about a medical industry that puts profits ahead of patients.
                    The End of Healing is being used by colleges and universities as a core text for courses on health
                    policy and medical sociology, ethics, and humanism.</p>
